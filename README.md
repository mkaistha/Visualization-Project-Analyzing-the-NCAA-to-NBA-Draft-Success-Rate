# Visualization-Project-Analyzing-the-NCAA-to-NBA-Draft-Success-Rate

### Summary:

The  NBA  recently  celebrated  its  75th  anniversary  and  the  popularity  of  the  sport  is increasing by the day. The game which was invented by James Naismith in 1981 has evolved from a sport to a culture over the years. The level of competition, intense work ethic and versatile skills of  players  in  the  current  age  of  basketball  has  made  this  sport  unique  and  fun  to  watch.  The fanbase for the NBA is almost 450 million with players earning as much as 20 million a year. 

But this is all that we see and celebrate. What happens behind the picture is the crucial part of the process and this is the NBA draft that takes place annually where teams compete over fresh talents. These players can make or break a franchise, and this is why making rational and right decisions are very important. 

Every year, the 30 NBA franchises try to inch closer to winning a championship and a lot of big decisions could influence the fate of their team. One of these main decisions is the NBA Draft where the team gets to add fresh, young talent on their roster. But what is the NBA Draft system  all  about?  Do  all  Drafted  players  actually  make  it  big  in  the  game?  How  do  players  fall  under the ‘Steals or Busts’ category? 

This project is targeted towards visualizing the transition of college basketball players into the NBA to understand the reasons behind their success rates in the pro league. A holistic review of the performance of players drafted over the past 40 years shall be compared to understand what went wrong with some of the picks. Several players of the recent 2019 draft class will be analyzed and matched to a team they would fit best with and why. Moreover, changes in trends of the drafts since 1974 to 2021 will be visualized on various levels. Overall, we hope that this project will reveal underlying patterns and trends to help teams understand which player would be  a  good  fit  on  their  roster  to  make  better  business  decisions  using  different types of data  visualizations to explore an extensive array of datasets.
